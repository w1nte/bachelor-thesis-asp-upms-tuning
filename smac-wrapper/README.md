# Clingo-SMAC
This project is an adaption of the algorithm configurator [SMAC3](https://github.com/automl/SMAC3) for [clingo-dl](https://potassco.org/labs/clingodl/) (1.1.0) and [clasp](https://potassco.org/) (3.3.5).
Clingo-SMAC is mostly inspired by [piclasp](https://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/piclasp/), unfortunately piclasp has not been further developed since 2015.
