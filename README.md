# Bachelor Thesis
This github repository contains all important files of my bachelor thesis.
This bachelor thesis is about improvement and tuning of scheduling problems formulated as Answer-Set-Program.

## Directories

### ./cluster-experiments
Contains all experiments for the cluster.

### ./encodings
Contains all encodings.

### ./instances
Contains all instances. These must be generated by executing `instances/create_instances.sh`.

### ./smac-wrapper
Contains the clingo/clingo-dl wrapper for SMAC3. See [smac-wrapper/README.md](./smac-wrapper/README.md) for more information.

### ./utils
Contains scripts and small helper utilities.

## Cluster
We use `HTCondor 8.4.2` for parallelization of our benchmarks.
All applications below must be installed by hand. I recommend to install python3 and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) in the user directory. Then using conda to install the remaining applications.
